# arduino-python-energy-monitor
This project involves creating a Python-powered IoT-based energy monitoring and control system. The system will collect real-time data from connected sensors (e.g., power consumption, voltage, and current sensors) and provide a visual dashboard for analysis. Additionally, the system can control devices remotely, optimizing energy usage.
